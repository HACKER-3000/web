# vspace.one landing page
This repo is used to create the landing page at [http://vspace.one](vspace.one).

## contrib
We use pull requests for every change that may be discuable or damage the page view. We also provide a beta version where changes get tested at [http://beta.vspace.one](beta.space.one). The beta page is mirroring the beta branch every hour. The landing page is pulled from the master branch, so keep this in mind when pushing something to it
